#![no_std]
//! ## Storage-key layout
//!
//! Bill and schedule state lives in **instance storage**. Request-key receipts
//! use individual persistent-storage entries so one retry record can expire or
//! be extended independently from the business state. The two primary bill
//! keys are:
//!
//! - `NEXT_ID: u32` -- a monotonically increasing counter. It only ever
//!   increases (on `create_bill`, and again on the auto-created next bill
//!   inside `pay_bill` when a recurring bill comes due); it is never
//!   decremented, even when the bill it was minted for is later removed via
//!   `cancel_bill`. This makes `NEXT_ID` an upper bound on bill ids that
//!   have ever existed, not a count of bills that currently exist.
//! - `BILLS: Map<u32, Bill>` -- every bill ever created, keyed by the id it
//!   was minted with. **Ids in this map are not contiguous**: `cancel_bill`
//!   removes an entry outright rather than tombstoning it, so `1..=NEXT_ID`
//!   is a valid *iteration range* (see `get_all_bills`, `get_unpaid_bills`,
//!   `get_overdue_bills`) but must always be probed with `Map::get` --
//!   never assumed to be present -- since cancelled ids leave gaps.
//!
//! The instance keys share one TTL, bumped together by `extend_instance_ttl` on
//! every write. There is no per-bill TTL: a single bill cannot outlive (or
//! be evicted independently of) the rest of this contract's instance
//! storage.
